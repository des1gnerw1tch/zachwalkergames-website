            A water shader I created for a racing boss level in my rhythm game hyperRunner2.5D. Endless moving waves
            scroll and tile seamlessly. The base mesh of the water is simply a subdivided plane that is UV unwrapped in Blender.

            I dive into the technical details and give some first impressions of the Unity/Shadergraph/HLSL graphics pipeline
            after I intially learned graphics programming in C++/OpenGL/GLSL.

            Here is where I have always posted my game development adventures. Thought I would start this blog
            to dive deeper into my projects, but I will still be using this IG page regularly.
