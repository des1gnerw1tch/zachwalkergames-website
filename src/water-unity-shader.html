    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p> In my upcoming rhythm game <a href="https://github.com/des1gnerw1tch/hyper-runner">hyperRunner2.5D</a> I am developing a boss fight that will take
    the form of a street race.
    I was introduced to real-time computer graphics after taking a computer graphics class in C++ and OpenGL. I'm excited to apply what I learned to my game.
    Let's make a water shader. I already had implemented a curved world shader that resembles animal crossing, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF0_1-8NWBs">following this great youtube tutorial</a> from Rigor Mortis Tortoise.
    This shader modifies the vertex positions of a mesh to emulate a curved world, lowering vertices that are farther away from the camera,
    similar to Subway Surfers or Animal Crossing. It looks great for the racing
    minigame. I used this shader as the base to create the dynamic water effect.</p>
    <h3>Preparing the Mesh with Blender</h3>
    <p>First thing I did was subdivide a plane in blender a couple times. 
        After experimentation 4,225 vertices gave me enough detail for small/medium 
        sized waves. These vertices will be manipulated by the water shader to emulate waves on the surface of water. The plane object was
        UV unwrapped as well, so it will work with our perlin noise.
    </p>

    <h3>Shadergraph</h3>
    <p>Below is the main section of the shader graph file.
    The curved world shader bits are added into the pipeline later, this
    image focuses on water. <i>outPos(3)</i> and <i>normal(3)</i> all the way on the top right
    are the end products that we feed into the <i>Position()</i> and <i>Normal()</i> channel 
    of the Fragment shader node.</p>
